# Kebab BOT

## Project Overview

This Discord bot is developed as part of my ongoing learning, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. The main focus of this project is to enhance my understanding of asynchronous programming, API integration, using a NoSQL database and real-time data processing.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Provides the asynchronous, event-driven environment, ideal for handling numerous server events and commands simultaneously.
- **discord.js**: A library that simplifies interacting with the Discord API, enabling the bot to efficiently manage messages, server events, and user interactions.
- **MongoDB**: Offers a robust NoSQL database solution for storing user data, ensuring fast and scalable data management.
- **Heroku**: A cloud platform service that hosts Kebab BOT, ensuring it remains online 24/7 with minimal downtime.

## Enhanced Features and Architecture

- **24/7 Availability**: Hosted on Heroku, Kebab BOT is always online!
- **Extended API Integrations**: Beyond weather statistics, Kebab BOT now leverages additional APIs, providing a wider range of information and services directly within Discord.
- **Advanced Database Schemas**: With more structured and complex data requirements, the MongoDB integration has been expanded with additional collections and schemas to accommodate new features.
- **Dynamic Command System**: The bot's command structure has been refined for greater modularity and ease of expansion, allowing for quick updates and additions to its capabilities.
- **Real-Time Movie Reviews**: Users can now submit and query movie reviews
- **PM2 for testing**: Using PM2 with another bot token, for testing purposes. When pushing to github, Heroku automatically uses the latest changes, with minimal downtime.


## Personal Learning Outcomes

- **Deployment and Hosting**: Gained experience in deploying and managing a Node.js application in a cloud environment, ensuring high availability and consistent performance.
- **Advanced Discord Bot Development**: Deep understanding of the Discord API and discord.js library, creating more complex interactions and features.
- **Enhanced Database Skills**: Expanded knowledge in MongoDB for more advanced data storage solutions
